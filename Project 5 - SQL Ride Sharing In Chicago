Project Description :

This SQL project focused on analyzing large-scale taxi ride data to uncover patterns in ride volume, trip duration, and company performance. The goal was to understand operational 
trends and identify key factors influencing ride behavior. The dataset included trip details such as timestamps, locations, and service providers.

To explore external influences, ride data was joined with weather datasets, allowing for analysis of how weather conditions impacted trip durations. SQL techniques such as aggregate 
functions, filtering, joins, and CASE statements were used to extract meaningful insights from the data.

Queries were optimized for performance and structured to support clear reporting. The final output included findings on peak ride times, high-performing taxi companies, and 
weather-related delaysâ€”providing actionable insights into both service efficiency and external risk factors.
