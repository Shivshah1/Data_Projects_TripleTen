Project description :

I carried out an in-depth analysis of e-commerce user behavior to understand the customer journey and identify areas for improving conversion and retention. The primary aim was 
to track how users progressed from initial product views to completing purchases, providing clear insights into funnel performance.

To do this, I constructed a conversion funnel that mapped each stage of user interaction on the platform. I then developed a cohort analysis by grouping users based on their 
first purchase date, allowing me to track retention trends over time. Using Excel's advanced functions and pivot tables, I calculated and visualized key performance metrics 
such as conversion rates, retention rates, and drop-off points within the funnel. This structured approach enabled a detailed breakdown of user engagement 
and purchasing behavior.

The final analysis offered actionable insights into user retention and conversion performance, helping inform strategic decisions at the executive level. The clarity and 
depth of the reporting ensured that key stakeholders could easily identify where to focus efforts to enhance user experience and drive growth.
