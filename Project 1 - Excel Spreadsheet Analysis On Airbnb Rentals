Project description:

I undertook a data-driven analysis of Airbnb listings to uncover insights into the most desirable neighborhoods and property types for short-term vacation rentals. The objective was 
to identify key factors contributing to higher rental demand and revenue potential using Excel-based tools.

The project began with data cleaning and preparation to ensure accuracy and consistency. I utilized advanced Excel functions such as SUMIF, IF, and PivotTables to segment the data by 
location, property size, and review volume. These tools enabled me to calculate revenue projections and identify top-earning listings. By constructing pivot tables, I was able to 
analyze patterns in rental activity and highlight how different property characteristics influenced performance. To effectively communicate these insights, I developed visual reports 
including bar charts and interactive dashboards that illustrated trends in demand and earnings across various neighborhoods. 

Through this analysis, I was able to provide actionable recommendations for optimizing Airbnb rental strategies. 
The findings offered a clear view of which property types and areas yield the highest returns, making the project valuable for hosts and investors 
seeking to make informed, data-backed decisions.
