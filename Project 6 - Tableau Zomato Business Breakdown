Project Description : 

This project involved analyzing restaurant and order data to uncover insights into cuisine popularity, sales performance by city and year, and top-rated restaurants. 
The data was cleaned thoroughly by removing duplicates, standardizing names, and organizing the dataset for easier analysis. A left join was performed to combine orders and 
restaurant data, allowing for a more complete view of customer preferences and sales trends.

The analysis revealed that ‘Goan, Maharashtrian’ cuisine had the highest average rating across the dataset, and that Burger Rani ranked as the top-rated individual restaurant. 
Tirupati emerged as the city with the highest overall sales, and 2018 stood out as the year with the most orders and revenue generated. These patterns pointed to both geographic 
and temporal trends in consumer behavior.

The findings suggested that regional cuisine offered outside of its home area—such as Goan food thriving in southern cities like Tirupati—can drive strong customer interest. 
This indicates that cross-regional culinary offerings and targeted advertising could lead to increased engagement and higher order volumes. Focusing on diverse cuisine options 
across cities may present a valuable growth opportunity for restaurant businesses.
