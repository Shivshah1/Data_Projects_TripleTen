Project description:

I analyzed data from Zomato’s restaurant and order records in India to understand customer preferences and sales patterns. By combining the restaurants and orders tables, I looked at 
cuisine ratings, restaurant ratings, yearly orders, and sales by city.

The analysis showed that “Goan, Maharashtrian” cuisine was the most popular in 2018, especially in the city of Tirupati. This was interesting because Tirupati is in the south, and the 
popularity of a non-local cuisine suggests that people enjoy trying food from different regions. 2018 also had the highest number of orders, indicating strong customer demand 
that year.

These results suggest that offering regional cuisines in different parts of India could boost sales. For example, promoting South Indian food in northern cities might attract more 
customers and increase orders. Restaurants and delivery services like Zomato could grow by using these insights to plan their menus and marketing strategies.
