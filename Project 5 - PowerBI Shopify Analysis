Project Description :

This Power BI project focused on analyzing over 2,000 Shopify apps using scraped data from the App Store. The goal was to understand what drives app success by exploring 
factors like ratings, reviews, categories, and developer performance. The data was cleaned and modeled across multiple tables to support detailed analysis.

An interactive dashboard was built with multiple pages highlighting app landscape, user feedback, and performance. Custom DAX columns such as helpful_reviews and 
developer_answered were used to measure review quality and developer responsiveness. Visuals included KPI cards, bar charts, and scatterplots for intuitive insights.

The analysis revealed trends between review volume and app ratings, and helped rank developers based on engagement. The dashboard offered drill-down filters to explore 
specific categories or apps, delivering a clear, data-driven view of the Shopify App Store.
