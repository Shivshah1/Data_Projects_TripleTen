Project Description :

This Tableau project focused on analyzing sales and returns data to understand return patterns and uncover potential issues in customer behavior. After importing and cleaning 
the dataset, calculated fields were used to categorize return reasons and prepare the data for deeper analysis.

Interactive dashboards were built to visualize trends across customer types, product categories, and regions. A geographic map highlighted return rates by state, while bar charts and 
filters allowed for exploration of product-level and customer-level return patterns.

The analysis revealed that a small group of customers accounted for a disproportionate number of returns, suggesting potential policy gaps or unusual buying behavior. The dashboards 
provided clear insights for stakeholders to improve return policies and reduce losses.
